/* 
    Note Section
    -> Apparently the formula to find the current location of color memory is:
        C = 37888 + 4 * (PEAK (36866) AND 128) [This formula is obviously in BASIC]
        So, the formula in 6502 ASM is:
        C = $9400 + 4 * ($9000 AND $80) [Obviously, this isn't right, just noting it down in a basic sense]
