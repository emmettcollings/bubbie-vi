/* 
    Notes

    -> When we've enabled multicolor mode, characters are 4x8 pixels instead of 8x8 pixels. (Halved horizontally, so we can use the mutlicolor mode)
    -> $0x286 is the address for the color that is currently being printed. (We can manipulate this to change the color of each character)
