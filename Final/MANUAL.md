once you die, you need to reload the game prg.

# Bubbie the VIth

## Game Compilation
Execute the command `make` in this directory to compile the game. The game will be generated in bin/ as 'bubbie.prg'  
Note: You will need to change the compiler path in the Makefile to match your setup.  

**Important: Three directories are required to compile the game, this current directory, 'justinLib/', and 'lib/'.** (I'd assume this won't be a problem, as you've pulled the entire repository.)

## Playing the Game
Once the game is compiled, you can run it in your favorite emulator.  

When you start the game, you will be presented with a title screen. Press any key to start the game (Due to how the game loop is designed, you'll need to hold the key down for ~1 second before the game will start).
