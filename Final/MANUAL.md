once you die, you need to reload the game prg.

# Bubbie the VIth

## Game Compilation
Execute the command `make` in this directory to compile the game. The game will be generated in bin/ as 'bubbie.prg'  
Note: You will need to change the compiler path in the Makefile to match your setup.  

**Important: Three directories are required to compile the game, this current directory, 'justinLib/', and 'lib/'.** (I'd assume this won't be a problem, as you've pulled the entire repository.)

## Playing the Game
Once the game is compiled, you can run it in your favorite emulator.  

When you start the game, you will be presented with a title screen. Press any key to start the game (Due to how the input loop is designed, to allow us to play music on the title screen, you'll need to hold the key down for ~0.2 second before the game will start).

## Game Objective
The objective is to find and collect 7 duckies, a duck will appear right above the health of the main character.
There are ladders spawn randomly around where you move to them you can go underground and move to the next level 
## Game Controls

to attack the enemey you must face the direction the enemy is in and move towards them.

## Known Bugs
The enemy will damage you before you can attack them as they parallelly move based on your direction.
An enemy spawns sometimes when we move and the main character overlaps them.
