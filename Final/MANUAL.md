once you die, you need to reload the game prg.

# Bubbie the VIth

## Game Compilation
Execute the command `make` in this directory to compile the game. The game will be generated in bin/ as 'bubbie.prg'  
Note: You will need to change the compiler path in the Makefile to match your setup.  

**Important: Three directories are required to compile the game, this current directory, 'justinLib/', and 'lib/'.** (I'd assume this won't be a problem, as you've pulled the entire repository.)
