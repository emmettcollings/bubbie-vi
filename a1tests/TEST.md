# Test 1
This test is purely to ensure everything is functioning correctly.

# Test 2

# Test 3
This test plays a really annoying sound, it's still being worked on, as I don't fully understand how the volume, patch, etc, works.

# Test 4
This test just changes the background color.

# Test 5
This test just simply clears the screen and prints to the center of the screen.

# Test 6
This test just simply tests disabling the cursor flash.

# Test 7
This test just simply is attempting to change screen size and font size. (Results in a lot of garbage on the screen, so I'd have to figure out what's going on there, but it does resize and change font size, so that's good.)

# Test 8
This test simply waits for input from the user, and then prints it to the screen. (I have 0 clue of the mapping from keyboard to VIC-20, so it's kinda funny seeing random garbage being print on the screen lol.)
